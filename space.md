| Enpulsion  | xx | Austrian company selling FEEP thrusters. They get very high ISP (3000 to 5000), use liquide indium metal and porous tungsten secret sauce in a 1U module (also scaling up to bigger sizes). They are probably the most mature product out there for electric cubesat propulsion. They have built a factory to be able to pump out several thrusters a week.  |
| Accion  | xx | similar concept but smaller with ionic liquid and based in the US. They basically have a thruster on a chip  |
| ThrustMe  | xx | French company developing a small cathodeless ion thruster working with iodine. They have hit a few snag so their first product will probably be a more classical xenon one with a cathode. |
| Exoterra Corp  | founded | supposedly developing a small iodine fed Hall thruster. Not a lot of info but they got a NASA contract |
